Exercise 7 : chi square test for independence 
# 1. Create Contingency Table
# Let's consider a study about the preference of two types of sports (Football and Basketball)
# among males and females in a sample of 100 individuals.

# Contingency Table: Rows = Gender, Columns = Sport Preference
gender_sport <- matrix(c(30, 10, 20, 40), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list("Gender" = c("Male", "Female"),
                  "Sport" = c("Football", "Basketball")))

# Display the contingency table
cat("Contingency Table:\n")
print(gender_sport)

# 2. Perform Chi-Square Test for Independence
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(gender_sport)

# 3. View Test Results
cat("\nChi-Square Test Results:\n")
print(chi_square_test)

# 4. Interpretation
if (chi_square_test$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("\nConclusion: The variables are not independent (reject the null hypothesis).\n")
} else {
  cat("\nConclusion: The variables are independent (fail to reject the null hypothesis).\n")
}
