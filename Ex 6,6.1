# 1. Create Dataset
# Independent variable: Hours of study
# Dependent variable: Marks obtained

marks <- c(50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95)

# Plot the scatter plot

     xlab = "Hours of Study",
     ylab = "Marks Obtained",
     pch = 16,
     col = "blue")

# 2. Perform Simple Linear Regression
model <- lm(marks ~ hours)

# 3. View Model Summary
print(summary(model))

# 4. Plot the Regression Line
abline(model, col = "red")

# 5. Predict Marks for 6.5 hours of study
predicted_marks <- predict(model, data.frame(hours = 6.5))
